## Usage Guide

### Getting Started

   - Upload HR policy PDF file
   - Upload ZIP file containing invoices

4. **Monitor Analysis**
   - Watch real-time progress updates

   - Expand individual invoice details
   - Check policy violations and reimbursement amounts

6. **Chat with Results**

- "Show me invoices over â‚¹5000"

### Troubleshooting

#### Backend Connection Issues

- **Error**: "Backend Offline"
- **Solution**: Start the FastAPI server: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`

#### File Upload Issues

- **Error**: File size too large
- **Solution**: Check that files are under 200MB, compress if needed
